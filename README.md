## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To get started with the Agrisour App, follow these steps for the initial build:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (version 3.0 or higher)
- **Android Studio** or **VSCode** with Flutter/Dart extensions
- **Firebase account** with a configured project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imtangim/Agrisour.git
cd Agrisour
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set Api key

Navigate to the project `lib/core/theme/keys.dart`:

```bash
class KeysForApi {
    static const String geminiKey =  "Your gemini key";
    static const String openWeatherKey = "You open weather api key";
}
```

### 4. Set Up Firebase

1. Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, and register your Android and iOS apps.
2. Create Project and add flutter app.

### 5. Set Up Google Authentication

1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**.
2. Enable **Google** as a sign-in provider.
3. For Android:

   - Ensure that you have added the correct SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys in your Firebase project settings.
   - You can get the SHA keys using the following command (replace `path_to_keystore` and `alias_name` with your values):

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore path_to_keystore -alias alias_name -storepass your_password
   ```

4. For iOS:
   - Ensure that **reversed client ID** from the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` is correctly set in your Xcode project under the URL schemes.

5. Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place them in the appropriate directories:
   - **For Android**: Place `google-services.json` in `android/app/`.
   - **For iOS**: Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`.

### 6. Run the App

For Android:

```bash
flutter run
```

For iOS:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=FLUTTER_BUILD_MODE=debug
```

### 7. Configure NPK Sensor

- Ensure that your NPK sensor is properly connected and configured with the app. Refer to the documentation for sensor calibration.
  Here‚Äôs a nicely formatted schema for the real-time database that you can add to your Markdown file:

### 8. AI-Based Leaf Disease Detection

- Make sure to enable camera access to take pictures for disease detection.

### 9. Real-time Data Collection

- Set up and calibrate the sensors for collecting soil moisture, temperature, and flood conditions.

## üìä Realtime Database Schema For Firebase Realtime Database

### Database URL

```
https://you-project.firebaseio.com/
```

### Schema Structure

```json

  "sensor_data": {
    "humidity": 0.6,
    "moisture": 0.8,
    "nitrogen": 110,
    "phosphorus": 130,
    "potassium": 110,
    "temperature": 30
  }

```

### Explanation of Fields

- **humidity**: The current humidity level measured in percentage (0.0 - 1.0).
- **moisture**: The soil moisture level measured in percentage (0.0 - 1.0).
- **nitrogen**: The nitrogen content in the soil (in mg/kg).
- **phosphorus**: The phosphorus content in the soil (in mg/kg).
- **potassium**: The potassium content in the soil (in mg/kg).
- **temperature**: The current temperature measured in degrees Celsius.

This schema captures the essential sensor data required for monitoring agricultural conditions, aiding farmers in making informed decisions.
